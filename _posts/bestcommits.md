title: 'The Best Commit Messages'
excerpt: '
The best commit messages are like retrospective task list items.
When we return to these commit messages, we should be able to recreate the project just by following them like steps. We can also use them as material for something else such as a tutorial, a project timeline, or a project review.
Some people describe them as instructions for a computer; instead, these are described as instructions for a human.
The best commit messages are also concise but clear and easy to understand.
In the ideal situation, all the commit messages are planned out ahead of time by creating a solid list of project tasks, deadlines, milestones, etc.

## The best Commit Messages

The best commit messages are like retrospective task list items. For example:

```

- Add a footer to the main page for social links.
    
- Implement a payment system for buying merch.
    
- Expand details on the About page to explain what our mission is.

```

When we return to these commit messages, we should be able to recreate the project just by following them like steps. We can also use them as material for something else such as a tutorial, a project timeline, or a project review.

Some people describe them as instructions for a computer; instead, they are more akin to a guide for a human.

The best commit messages are also concise but clear and easy to understand.

A bad set of commits would then be:

```

# What? Why? How? Where?
- Add links. 

# This step is too big and vague.
- Add merch. 

# What part of it?
- Update the About page. 

```

Ideally, all the commit messages are planned in advance with a solid list of project tasks, deadlines, milestones, etc.
