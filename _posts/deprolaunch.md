excerpt: '
Ideas are everywhere and they shape our reality. They are real, living, breathing, things that are solid tangible; they have a whole life cycle just like us. Some of them are straightforward, ordinary, practical and a little boring, some are eureka moments, some are roller coaster rides. All of them follow the same process: conception, birth, life, and death. This is an exploration of each stage so that we can focus on what matters most.

## Design Prototype Launch

Ideas are everywhere and they shape our reality. They are real, living, breathing, things that are solid tangible; they have a whole life cycle just like us. Some of them are straightforward, ordinary, practical and a little boring, some are eureka moments, some are roller coaster rides. All of them follow the same process: conception, birth, life, and death. This is an exploration of each stage so that we can focus on what matters most.
