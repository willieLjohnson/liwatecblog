However, it may also be less customizable and may not offer as much control as creating your own game engine or using a programming language.

To begin, we will dive into the most basic way of creating a game: with just a programming language.

## Choosing a Programming Language.

In game development, there are several programming languages to choose from, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some popular options include C++, C#, and Python. Here are some things to consider when choosing a programming language for your game.

### Consider your goals.

What kind of game are you looking to create? Different programming languages are better suited to different types of games. For example, creating fast-paced and action-packed games will require low-level and performant languages like C, C++, or Rust. 

On the other hand, if you want to create more casual, puzzle-based games, a minimalistic and high-level language like Python, JavaSript, and LUA might be a better fit because you'll get more time to focus on the story rather than the code. These languages are known for their simplicity and ease of use, making them a good choice for beginner developers,  prototyping ideas quickly, or creating basic games.

Here are some things to consider when picking a language:

### Look for versatility.

Choosing a programming language that is versatile enough to handle a wide range of tasks can be crucial for your project. This will allow you to be more productive and efficient as you work on your game. For example, C# is a popular choice for game development due to its versatility. This enables you to create different genres of games, from 2D mobile games to complex 3D PC games. Additionally, C# has a large and active community, which means you'll have access to a wealth of resources and support as you work on your game.
    
### Focus on speed. 

Game development often requires fast processing speeds. The performance of your game can be a crucial factor for gamers, so choosing a programming language that can keep up is a must. C++ is generally considered one of the fastest languages, but we also have other options like Rust and Go that are really good at what they do. 

Rust is a relatively new programming language that has gained popularity in the game development community due to its speed and safety features. 

Go is another fast language known for its simplicity and concurrency support. Great for creating multiplayer games, and because of its simplicity, it can be used in places where you would use Python and Typescript mentioned above.

## Making a game engine.

Despite the substantial overhead, creating your own game engine also has some benefits that should be heavily considered. Create a unique game engine with features not available in others, and you differentiate yourself from other developers and gain a competitive advantage in the market.

If you're looking to create a game engine from scratch, you'll need a strong understanding of computer science and programming. Building a game engine can be complex and time-consuming, so it's important to be prepared for the challenges ahead. 

You'll need to design and implement the core systems necessary for creating games, such as a rendering engine, a physics engine, and an input system. You'll also need to consider how to design the engine to be modular and extensible so that developers can easily add new features or customize existing ones. It's not a task for the faint of heart. But if you're up for the challenge, creating your own game engine can be a rewarding experience; you gain a better understanding of how games are made, and you have a tool you can share with other developers.

Here are some of the benefits of creating your own engine.

### Customization.

By creating your own game engine, you have complete control over the tools and features that are included. This can allow you to create a game engine tailored to your needs and goals.
    
### Learning opportunity.

Creating a game engine can be a challenging and educational experience that allows you to deepen your understanding of game development and computer science concepts.
    
### Competitive advantage.
    
However, there are also potential drawbacks to creating a game engine. It can be a complex and time-consuming process that requires a deep understanding of computer science and programming. Additionally, creating a game engine may not be necessary for all game development projects, and using a pre-made game engine may be a faster and more efficient choice.

## Choosing a game engine.

If you decide that creating your own game engine isn't the right path, there are many pre-made game engines available for free. Some popular options include Godot, Unity, Unreal Engine, and GameMaker. The important thing here is to consider the type of game you want to create, the platforms you want to target, and the level of complexity you're comfortable with. Unity, for example, is a popular choice for creating 2D and 3D games for a wide range of platforms, including mobile, desktop, and consoles. It offers a user-friendly interface and a wealth of resources and support for developers. Alternatively, Unreal Engine is a more powerful engine geared towards creating high-quality, visually stunning games. It is primarily used for creating 3D games, but you can also make 2D games. GameMaker is the simplest of the bunch of engines that focus on 2D games. It's particularly popular with beginners.

Here's a short list of potential benefits gained by using a game engine:

-   Ease of use: Game engines often have a user-friendly interface and a set of pre-built tools and features that make it easier for developers to create games. This can be particularly helpful for beginners or anyone looking to prototype ideas quickly.
    
-   Speed: Game engines can often provide a faster development process, as they provide a ready-made set of tools and features that can save time and effort compared to building everything from scratch using a programming language.
    
-   Cross-platform support: Many game engines support multiple platforms, allowing developers to easily create games once and have them play on different devices.
    
-   Community and resources: Game engines often have a large and active community of developers, which can provide valuable support, resources, and guidance as you work on your game.

That being said, there are also potential drawbacks to using a game engine. Some game engines may be less customizable and with less control over which programming language you can use. If you are creating highly specialized or demanding games that require low-level access to hardware, using a programming language or creating a game engine may be a better choice.

## Creating the Game

Once you've chosen a programming language or game engine, the next step is to create the game itself. It's time for all the research to pay off. Here are some tips to help get you started.
